# MannAAskingQuestions

Review Comments: I like the way the code is been written, is easy to understand and follow, I like how you went from the Do while with yes no and Y n providing more options to the user, and after that goes into an if statement depending on the Do While, The play again feauture works as coded requesting the user for valid input in case they enter other than the provided options, good Job :)
